# About me

Hi, my name is Denilson Nastacio, and I work in tech for Big Co (IBM.) You can find my professional information on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nastacio/), but here are some highlights.

I started in 1997 and had fantastic opportunities to work on fun things, such as locating hardware in a data center using air temperature (ask me about it) and training an Artificial Intelligence to find treatments for cancer patients (ask me about it too!)

For a few years, I was tasked with designing the operations engineering practice for a global service hosting over 100K applications.

Eventually, I switched projects and started applying the lessons learned ... everywhere ... from regular coding activities to designing new systems.

I have written a lot of code in Java, C, C++, Python, and Shell Scripting.

Nowadays, I am still interested in deeply technical subjects such as [Kubernetes probes](https://sourcepatch.blogspot.com/2022/01/kubernetes-probes-part-3-promql.html) and [GitOps](https://sourcepatch.blogspot.com/search/label/gitops), though I also spend some time in higher abstractions that affect the way technical folks relate to their work, such as in ["What is the hardest thing in software development?"](https://nastacio.github.io/naming-reality) and ["Technical Debt"](https://nastacio.github.io/debt)

You can read my technical articles and essays in my website at [https://nastacio.github.io](https://nastacio.github.io).
